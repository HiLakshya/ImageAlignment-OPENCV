# Image Alignment using ORB Features

This Python script aligns two images using ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) features and homography transformation. It is useful for tasks such as image stitching and registration.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HiLakshya/ImageAlignment-OPENCV.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd ImageAlignment-OPENCV
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python image_alignment.py
    ```
